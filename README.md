BlueSG Charging Station Location Optimisation

My group and I worked upon this project to solve the issue of a lack of BlueSg charging stations for BlueSG cars in the central business district. (especially during the start of the day/ working periods in which users will drive to the Central Business district area. Thus, we mapped out Singapore Central Business District into a rectangle (refer to in depth details in pdf file). 
For simplicity, we assumed certain parameters, namely:
  1. The demand of each small square in the CBD to follow a Normal distribution
  2. The probability of rain 
  3. The affect a rainy day has upon the demand for BlueSg cars
  4. The amount of boxes each charging station can accommodate

We also did further sensitivity analysis on:
  1. The ratio of BlueSg cars supplied to customers
  2. The rental fee per minute
  3. The probability of a rainy day in the CBD
  4. The mean demand per box

The aforementioned methods were used to derive the most optimal number of charging locations in the CBD, using Monte Carlo simulation to derive an expected profit of a 1000 profits of each scenario we formulated. 

I've attached the Excel and Report file (pdf) for better understanding of the project!
